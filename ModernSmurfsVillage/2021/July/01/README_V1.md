# Session 1 - July 1st 2021

## Smurfs village (modern)

Earlier today, I was going through my music to try and find some good ambient music to work with that hasn't been overplayed recently. I stumbled across Smurfs Village again and got hit by a massive wave of nostalgia. I decided that I wanted to play the game again and re-experience it, so I started playing tonight after I finished my work a lot earlier than of lately.

### What changed

I haven't played this game in at least 7 years. There were many things that have changed, but the core game seems to be mostly untouched. Some parts got "modernized" the title screen was removed, and there were other changes, and very likely many new features, but the core gameplay as I remember it is mostly the same.

## Progress

### Level progress

I went from level 1 to level 10 today, with mostly unaltered gameplay. The first bridge I remember used to take a week to repair, but now it only seems to take a couple hours.

### Thanksgiving

I bought the Thanksgiving statue, something I couldn't have done a long time ago. It was done for reasons I can't explain right now.

### Play duration

I played for about 2 hours or more tonight. I might make this a daily game, right now, it is just a "when I feel like it" game.
