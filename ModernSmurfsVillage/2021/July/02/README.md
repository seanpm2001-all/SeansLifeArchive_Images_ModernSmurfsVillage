# Session 2

## July 2nd 2021

I played the game again today, it is now a daily game.

### Early session

I had a short session in the evening to prepare crops and finish some objectives. I then quit for over 5 hours.

### Midnight session

I had a longer session tonight, doing the usual tasks, and objectives. I made a little bit of progress, and began to grow pumpkins for the next time I play, since they take 18 hours to grow.

### Tile change

I changed my profile tile today.

### Other changes noted

I have noted that the games dialogue sequence may have been changed since the last time I played, although I am growing to dislike the dialogue.

### Level progress

I leveled up to level 11 today.
